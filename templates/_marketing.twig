        <p>
            Weâ€™re pleased to announce our conference. The OpenWest Conference is
            one of the best Open Source conferences where community members from around
            the western U.S. come together to learn and share information about the latest
            trends and technologies in development, system adminstration, and more.
        </p>
        
        <h4 class="headline">Diversity Matters!</h4>
        <p>
            We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
            where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
            is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor representatives to be
            professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
            ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speakers are expected to read and abide by our full <a href="http://www.openwest.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
