		<h4 class="headline">Blind community voting</h4>
		<p>
			We use blind community voting as the main factor in deciding which speakers to invite.
			Other factors include the number of talks per topic, travel cost, and the number
			of talks submitted by that speaker. We do NOT take into consideration gender, race, religion, or
			sexual orientation.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="headline">Code of Conduct</h4>
		<p>
			We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place
			where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment
			is not tolerated</strong>. We expect speakers, attendees and sponsor representatives to be
			professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund,
			ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Speakers are expected to read and abide by our full <a href="http://www.openwest.org/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
		</p>
		
		<h4 class="headline">Audience Peculiarities</h4>
		<p>
			It's always good practice to know your audience.  Many of the OpenWest Conference attendees are Utah residents who prefer workplace appropriate language.  
			Obscene remarks or the heavy use of profanity will not be appreciated by the majority of attendees.
